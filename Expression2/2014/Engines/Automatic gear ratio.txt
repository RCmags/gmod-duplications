#Engine can start and iddle. Transmission varies to keep engine rpm constant at 800 rpm. (aproximately maximum Hp rpm)
#Engine throttle is varied with W and S after engine starts up with R. 
#There is no backwards
#After 300 throttle the clutch engages and the wheels are driven by the engine. 

#A configuration to consider is to use W and S to vary the gear ratio while the engine runs at max throttle and is kept from 
#overspeeding by the throttle limiter. 
#By changing the gear ratio easy forward and backwards motion can be obtained
