#Input dimensions

L = 2 #Length of spar lever arm
R = 1.5 #Radius of the crank
K = 8 #Distance between lever hinge and crank center
G = 0.1 #Conrod offset. Adjust this to get desired Up or down flap angles

#Note: inch = foot*12

#Offset Crank geometry:

H = sqrt(K^2 + L^2)

X = R*L/H

Y = sqrt(R^2 - X^2)

D = 2*X #Length of crank offset

A = atan(Y/X) #Angle between crank and offset crank

Rr = A + atan(Y/(X - H)) #Angle between wing spar and conrod when conrods are most assymetric in orientation

#Flap amplitude and conrod: (does not include offset in calculations) 

M = sqrt(K^2 + (L - R)^2)

C = M + G#Conrod length

Am = acos((2*R*(L - R) - 2*M*(G + R) - G*(2*R + G))/(2*K*L)) - 90 #Upwards flap angle

An = 90 - acos((2*R*(L - R) + 2*M*(R - G) + G*(2*R - G))/(2*K*L))#Downwards flap angle

At = Am + An #Total flap angle
